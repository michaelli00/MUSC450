# Cadences

**Cadences** occur at the end of phrases (e.g. imagine where a singer might breathe)

&nbsp;

**Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)**: Secure and stable cadence going from a $\Romannum{5}$ chord (point of tension) to a $\Romannum{1}$ chord (point of release)

- Both chords must be in root position
- Melody line must land on the tonic and approach it step-wise
- Considered the "most perfect" cadence

&nbsp;

**Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC)**: Secure and stable cadence going from a $\Romannum{5}$ chord (point of tension) to a $\Romannum{1}$ chord (point of release) but either

- One of the two chords is NOT in root position
- Melody line doesn't land on the tonic or doesn't arrive at the tonic by step

&nbsp;

**Half Cadence**: Non-secure, unstable, unresolved, "questioning" kind of cadence where the phrase ends with the lingering tension of a $\Romannum{5}$ chord

- **Note**: Preceding chord doesn't matter, only the final chord matters (must be a $\Romannum{5}$ chord, usually on a strong beat)

&nbsp;

**Plagal Cadence**: Secure move from $\Romannum{4}$ to $\Romannum{1}$

- If PC occurs after a strong cadence, usually called an "amen" cadence in church music (or **post cadential plagal gesture**)

&nbsp;

**Deceptive Cadence**: Composer uses long-standing expectation of cadential closure to trick listeners (usually $\Romannum{5}$ to $\romannum{6}$ instead of $\Romannum{5}$ to $\Romannum{1}$

# Levels of Metrical perceptions

We can view beats/meter at varying levels

- Beats
- Measures as beats (**hypermeter**)
- Phrases/Half-phrases as beats

# Extending, Expanding, and Connecting Phrases

**Motivic Anticipation**: Beginning phrase is repeated before the phrase continues to anticipate the main motive

**Interpolation**: Material in the middle of the phrase extends on previous material

**Standing on the Dominant**: Dominant is emphasized and lengthened (usually occurs at the end of the phrase)

**Cadential Extension**: Entire cadential "turn around" is repeated (usually occurs at the end of the phrase)

**Echo**: End of phrase is repeated by secondary voice (doesn't have to occur at the end)

**Phrase Elision**: Rather than cadencing, composers will elide (omit) an PAC/IAC with the beginning of the next phrase

**Melodic Links**: Keeping melodic energy going even as harmony comes to a cadential closure
