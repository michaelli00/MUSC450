# Cadences

**Cadences** occur at the end of phrases (e.g. imagine where a singer might breathe)

&nbsp;

**Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)**: Secure and stable cadence going from a $\Romannum{5}$ chord (point of tension) to a $\Romannum{1}$ chord (point of release)

- Both chords must be in root position
- Melody line must land on the tonic and approach it step-wise
- Considered the "most perfect" cadence

&nbsp;

**Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC)**: Secure and stable cadence going from a $\Romannum{5}$ chord (point of tension) to a $\Romannum{1}$ chord (point of release) but either

- One of the two chords is NOT in root position
- Melody line doesn't land on the tonic or doesn't arrive at the tonic by step

&nbsp;

**Half Cadence**: Non-secure, unstable, unresolved, "questioning" kind of cadence where the phrase ends with the lingering tension of a $\Romannum{5}$ chord

- **Note**: Preceding chord doesn't matter, only the final chord matters (must be a $\Romannum{5}$ chord, usually on a strong beat)

&nbsp;

**Plagal Cadence**: Secure move from $\Romannum{4}$ to $\Romannum{1}$

- Called an "amen" cadence in church music (usually called a **post cadential plagal gesture**)

&nbsp;

**Deceptive Cadence**: Composer uses long-standing expectation of cadential closure to trick listeners (usually $\Romannum{5}$ to $\romannum{6}$ instead of $\Romannum{5}$ to $\Romannum{1}$
