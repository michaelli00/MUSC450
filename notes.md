# Cadences

**Cadences** occur at the end of phrases (e.g. imagine where a singer might breathe)

&nbsp;

**Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)**: Secure and stable cadence going from a $\Romannum{5}$ chord (point of tension) to a $\Romannum{1}$ chord (point of release)

- Both chords must be in root position
- Melody line must land on the tonic and approach it step-wise
- Considered the "most perfect" cadence

&nbsp;

**Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC)**: Secure and stable cadence going from a $\Romannum{5}$ chord (point of tension) to a $\Romannum{1}$ chord (point of release) but either

- One of the two chords is NOT in root position
- Melody line doesn't land on the tonic or doesn't arrive at the tonic by step

\end{figure}

&nbsp;

**Half Cadence**: Non-secure, unstable, unresolved, "questioning" kind of cadence where the phrase ends with the lingering tension of a $\Romannum{5}$ chord

- **Note**: Preceding chord doesn't matter, only the final chord matters (must be a $\Romannum{5}$ chord, usually on a strong beat)

&nbsp;

**Plagal Cadence**: Secure move from $\Romannum{4}$ to $\Romannum{1}$

- If PC occurs after a strong cadence, usually called an "amen" cadence in church music (or **post cadential plagal gesture**)

\end{figure}


&nbsp;

**Deceptive Cadence**: Composer uses long-standing expectation of cadential closure to trick listeners (usually $\Romannum{5}$ to $\romannum{6}$ instead of $\Romannum{5}$ to $\Romannum{1}$

# Levels of Metrical Perceptions

We can view beats/meter at varying levels

- Beats
- Measures as beats (**hypermeter**)
- Phrases/Half-phrases as beats

# Extending, Expanding, and Connecting Phrases

**Motivic Anticipation**: Beginning phrase is repeated before the phrase continues to anticipate the main motive

**Interpolation**: Material in the middle of the phrase extends on immediate previous material

**Standing on the Dominant**: Dominant is emphasized and lengthened (usually occurs at the end of the phrase)

**Cadential Extension**: Entire cadential "turn around" is repeated (usually occurs at the end of the phrase)

**Echo**: End of phrase is repeated by secondary voice (doesn't have to occur at the end)

**Phrase Elision**: Rather than cadencing, composers will elide (omit) an PAC/IAC with the beginning of the next phrase

**Melodic Links**: Keeping melodic energy going even as harmony comes to a cadential closure

# Constructing Short Musical Phrases

Musical phrases are perceived by

- Repetition
- Variation

**Sentences**: musical phrase with a balance of repetition and variation **with only one cadence**. Categorized into

- **Presentation**
  - **Basic Idea**: Most memorable part of the melody (may be repeated verbatim or tranposed)
  - **Varied Basic Idea**: Prolongation prolongs and confirms tonic-type harmonies **with no cadence**
- **Continuation**: derives material from the Basic Idea or presents new. Typically has repetition in the first half and adds variation in the second half
  - **Drive to Cadence**: Complex harmonies drive the music to a cadence
  - **Cadence**:

Continuations are usually marked by

- **Fragmentation**: small "germinal" motive from the Basic Idea extracted and modified
- **Sequencing**: Small musical ideas occur at one pitch level, then repeated a step higher/lower
- **Accelerated Melodic Motion**: Surface-level activity is increased, causing more subdivisions of the beat occurring in the melody
- **Greater Harmonic Variety**: Use more/different chords in the continuation than in the presentation
- **Faster Harmonic Rhythm**: Underlying harmonies change more rapidly in the continuation than in the presentation

&nbsp;

How is the basic idea varied: Slightly different harmonies (in the last beat), slightly different rhythm

- Presentation is first for 4 bars (BI 2 bars, VBI 2 bars)

Features that create momentum in the continuation

- Sequencing, greater harmonic variety, faster harmonic rhythm, accelerated melodic material, fragmentation (triplet theme)

# Periods

**Periods**: consist of 2 phrases: an **antecedent** that ends with a weak cadence, and a **consequent** that ends with a stronger cadence

- Antecedent ends with IAC $\implies$ Consequence ends with a PAC
- Antecedent ends with HC $\implies$ Consequence ends with an IAC or PAC

The strategy is a dialogue between a questioner and an answerer

&nbsp;

**Parallel Period**: Each of the two phrases begin with the same (or similar) musical material

- A character asks a question then answers that same question

&nbsp;

**Sequential Period**: Each of the two phrases being with the same (or similar) musical material BUT transposed up or down

- Musical characters have the same contour but begin and end in different places (increase or decrease drama)

&nbsp;

**Contrasting Period**: Each of the two phrases begins with different musical material

- A character asks a question and a different character answers it

&nbsp;

**Note**: Periods can be made up of two sentence and can use phrase modifications

&nbsp;

**PS**: Four-phrase phrase chains that fit into one of the following two cadential schemes

- **Double Period**: HC HC HC PAC
- **Repeated Period**: HC PAC HC PAC

# Forms

Two-part forms consist of several sub-categories within the **greater binary** classification

- First section usually ends with PAC in new key, HC in main key, or PAC/IAC in main key
- Second section ends with PAC in the main key

First section usually modulates to a second key, and the second section modulates back to te first key

If the piece is in major, the second key will likely be $\Romannum{5}$. Otherwise the second key will be $\Romannum{3}$

Instability in the second section comes from

- Standing on the dominant
- Sequences
- Rampant tonicizations

**Simple Binary**: Motivic material from first section does not directly return in the second section

**Rounded Binary**: Motivic material from the first secion returns at the end of the second section, resulting in ABA or ABA' (B section lacks a strong cadence)

**Balanced Binary**: Motivic material from the end of the first section returns at the end of the second section (can be transposed)

- First section ends in PAC in new key
- Second section ends with PAC in main key
